Racking and jacking my mind up.
Cannot be telling the time  I
Don't care  no.
I don't care  no.
You send thirty messages drunk 
And dirty messages drunk 
But I don't look.
No  I can't be *** to look.

I could not breathe.
You took your toll on me.
You're suffocating  please.
But since I watched you leave 

I can see for the first time.
And I can see for the first time.
And I can see for the first time 
For the first time.
And I can see for the first time.

You get jealous easily.
You did not make it easy.
But what was I expecting?
It's a very fitting ending.
You say I hurt you bad  well 
That was never my intent.
I was looking out for myself 
And all of my mental health.

I cannot breathe.
You took your toll on me.
You're suffocating  please.
But since I watched you leave 

I can see for the first time.
I can see for the first time.
I can see for the first time 
For the first time.
For the first time.
I can see for the first time.

There is no better deduction
There is no better solution
There is no better deduction
There is no better solution
There is no better deduction
There is no better solution
There is no better deduction
There is no better solution

I can see for the first time.
I can see for the first time.
I can see for the first time 
For the first time 
For the first time.
I can see for the first time.
I can see for the first time.
I can see for the first time.
For the first time 
For the first time.
