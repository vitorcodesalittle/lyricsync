The sun is fading under blood-red sky  
The reign of day is over 
Night soon will break free. 
They wake in the eerie glow of moonlight 
Forgotten souls  beyond our sight. 

World  that's gone forever 
Long ago  lost in their 
Eyes  that shine with mystery. 
Last remaining shadows 
Of lost time 
Whisper in the moonlight. 

Surprised you're waking in the morning. 
Can't understand your feelings  
And where d'you get these thoughts. 
Inside your mind the voice is calling 
For the night  to rise at your side. 

World  that's gone forever 
Long ago  lost in their 
Eyes  that shine with mystery. 
Last remaining shadows 
Of lost time 
Whisper in the moonlight. 

So hear their voice  
Sharing their yearning  
Gift they're giving to you. 
Hear their voice  
Sharing their memories - 
Sacred secrets from past time.

World  that's gone forever

So hear their voice  
Sharing their yearning
