he's
a
whistler
when
the
wind
blows
keeps
it
simple
only
whole
notes
plays
his
hollow
tune
effortlessly
he
just
sits
there
in
limbo
doesnt
listen
full
of
blow
holes
curtains
waver
the
old
refrain
repeats
a
penny
for
a
thought
for
pounds
of
flesh
hes
bought
a
peso
for
what
not
to
confess
here
the
last
shall
be
the
first
wordlessly
coerced
death
is
not
the
worst
atrocity
theres
a
hissing
through
the
window
like
a
twisted
virtuoso
warning
of
a
storm
brewing
again
to
the
victor
goes
the
intro
full
of
whispered
innuendo
time
once
more
for
a
paranoid
crusade
the
past
shall
be
reversed
the
dead
not
so
accursed
a
universe
rehearsed
in
tragedy
he's
a
whistler
hes
a
widow
doesnt
miss
her
plays
it
solo
blissfully
ignoring
his
instinct
tears
bitter
on
the
pillow
makes
his
mission
not
to
know
more
curtains
flutter
the
old
refrain
repeats
yeah
he's
a
widow
he's
a
whistler
he's
a
whistler
oh
