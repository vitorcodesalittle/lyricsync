Honey  I told you something
Sorry I didn’t hear
Maybe there was something …
Yeah  stuck in your ear
Why is it everytime  you say you do  you don’t?
Maybe I just thought that you were talking on the phone

Honey  you’re looking lovely tonight
Sorry  you’re wastin’ time
Baby  this ain’t your lucky night
Well  tryin’ ain’t a crime
Why is it everytime I’d like to do  you don’t?
Maybe you could try a little romance and a comb

Let’s go back in time
Way back when  we were
Lalalala la la lala
Now it’s married life
And a daily strife  to be
Lalalalala lalalalala lala
Lalalala la la lala

Honey  you’re getting’ older
Yeah  and you’re still 29
And maybe things are colder
But honey  still you’re mine
Guess it’s easy to forget
We’re more than man and wife
Could it be the “lala-magic” keeping love alive?

Let’s go back in time
Way back when  we were
Lalalala la la lala
Back when you and I
Still had time to be
Lalalalala lalalalala lala
Lalalala la la lala

Let’s go back in time
Way back when  we were
Lalalala la la lala
Back when you and I
Still had time to be
Lalalalala ….

Let’s go back in time
Way back when  we were
Lalalala la la lala
Now it’s married life
Still we have to try  to be
Lalalalala lalalalala lala
Lalalala la la lala
