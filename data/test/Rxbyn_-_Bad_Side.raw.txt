One  two  three
See you looking at me with those eyes
Four  five  six
I know that you want this
Am I right? Think I'm right
Let's skip the games
Fast forward to the "What's your name?"
Why take our time? Time
So one  two  three
Know you heard about me
That's alright
Just hit my line  oh

So come to me
Tonight  we don't have to be enemies
Keep it going like it's meant to be
Meant to be  just wait and see
So come with me
And maybe you can touch my body
Don't be scared to take ahold of me
Take me in and breathe  tear me up to pieces
Oh...

Get a taste of my bad side
Just a taste of my bad side
You want a taste of my bad side
Just a taste of my bad side
You wanna know what it feels like
To get a taste of my bad side

La di da di
Bet you'll think it's nothing
Till it drops all at once
Your heart
Oh my  oh me
I'm fucking crazy and I can't stop
It'll be fun  ha!
