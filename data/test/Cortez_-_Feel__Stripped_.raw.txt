Yeah oh 

Please don't stand over here  
Act like you care  so self-aware 
I know you were not scared 
I could've died  but that isn't fair  huh? 
But what am I supposed to think? 
You weren't there for me 
Cause I'm not who I should be for you 

You've got a record and a past 
Guess that's what makes me the ass 
I should've known  I should've cared 
How could I have been so unprepared? 
Now where does the good boy go to hide away  hide the pain? 
Cause you won't see me cry when I'm done 

What is it that you want from me want from me? 
What is it that you want from me want from me? 
I want you to feel  I want you to feel 
I want you to feel  I want you to feel 

I'm a feather in the wind 
Carried away by all that you say 
Sitting on thin air 
I'm a loss to my friends 
Too unpersuaded by all they're saying 
And you can't pretend to care  yeah 

Yeah. I was reckless in the past 
I was see-through just like glass 
Did all I could to make this last 
So how could you be such an ass? 
I know where the good boys go to hide the pain  hide the pain 
But that don't mean I die when you don't 

What is it that you want from me  want from me? 
What is it that you want from me  want from me? 
I want you to feel  I want you to feel 
I want you to feel  I want you to feel 

What is it that you want from me  want from me? 
What is it that you want from me  want from me? 
I want you to feel  I want you to feel 
I want you to feel  I want you to feel 

...good boys go to hide the pain  hide the pain 
Cause you won't see me cry when I'm done 
I know where the good boys go to hide the pain  hide the pain 
But that don't mean I die when you don'tâ€¦
