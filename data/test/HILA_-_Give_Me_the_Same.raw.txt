Lay awake at night
Wondering how could I
Let it get this way
Through all the pain
I took all the blame
While you cursed my last name
I thought we could get better
Stayed committed like a soldier
Believed we're okay
Now I know that you don't care  at all
Time wasted
Gave all of my soul and my heart to someone that would never
Give me the same
I was a fool to believe that you would finally be the one to
Give me the same
Heartbroken now
How you let me down
But somehow  deep down  I still do 
Love you
Now your out all night
Telling your lies
About the way I hurt you
They couldn't see the way
You made me feel ashamed
For choosing to love you
I began to see clearer
That you were just a liar
Stuck in your ways
So now I choose to walk away forever
Time wasted
Gave all of my soul and my heart to someone that would never
Give me the same
I was a fool to believe that you would finally be the one to
Give me the same
Heartbroken now
How you let me down
But somehow  deep down  I still do 
Love you
How could you just throw it all away babe
(How could you throw it all away)
I stayed with you through all the lies and pain
(Through all the lies and pain oh)
Tears roll down my eyes 
(Tears roll down my eyes)
As I now realize
Your love was never truly mine
At all
Time wasted
Gave all of my soul and my heart to someone that would never
Give me the same
I was a fool to believe that you (you) would finally (be the one too)
Give me the same
Heartbroken now
(Heartbroken now)
How you let me down
(Oh)
But somehow (how)  deep down I still do
Love you
