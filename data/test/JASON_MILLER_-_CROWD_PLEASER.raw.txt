Dull mother fuckers can’t never ever
Shine off me?
Wait for it

Wait for it 
Don’t worry the
My haters is gonna pay for it

Niggas chase whores
over sea’s
On a great tour
Or maybe I’m just dreaming
It beats being with demons or
A nigga scheming or
At least im thinking of an achievement 
People talk shit for 4 seasons 
For no reason 
people dog lebron until
lebron show up 
when he step on the paint then their
guards go up
scores up 
all the applauds go up 
and everybody in the whole damn court goes nuts

People gonna hate let them do it

Live life don’t say nothing to them

spectators 
side liners 
spending days
coming up with sly comments
that’s
psychotic 
why try a tarnish 
such a fly product?
Why be mad just cause I got? Hey!
I may never know 
Wave to the haters
That put me on the pedestal
talk smack
But they really
Know I’m incredible 
Unforgettable young blue eyes
the new guy 
is on schedule 
man behind bars and thats minus the federal 
Stone giant what the hell
Could some pebbles do
While you Revel In drama
Im building revenue 
Tell them you’ll get them tomorrow their ain’t
Nothing stressing you
Life goes on
Lifes goes on
You was the shit even
Before those lights went on
They gonna trash you
Even if they like your song
People always gonna judge homie
right or wrong?
