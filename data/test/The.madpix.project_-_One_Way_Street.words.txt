tears
are
like
diamonds
in
my
eyes
blind
me
so
now
youre
out
of
sight
its
enough
its
too
late
to
break
this
silence
in
a
rose
coloured
view
of
us
either
cause
could
i
realize
all
your
lies
would
be
blades
to
knifes
to
stab
me
inside
who
will
save
you
from
this
dark
who
will
fix
your
selfish
heart
a
one
way
street
thats
how
you
live
why
do
you
always
take
and
never
give
wide
awake
yeah
ive
crossed
the
line
im
coming
home
im
running
back
to
real
life
through
the
start
where
i
could
breathin
freely
baby
cant
you
see
we
ran
off
time
chasing
happiness
while
you
get
what
you
need
theres
nothing
left
of
us
but
bleeding
blades
and
knifes
tonight
youll
know
how
it
feels
a
one
way
street
thats
how
you
live
why
do
you
always
take
and
never
give
ill
walk
away
to
help
you
see
our
love
is
rolling
down
so
easily
a
one
way
street
a
one
way
street
you
never
give
ill
walk
away
so
easily
a
one
way
street
