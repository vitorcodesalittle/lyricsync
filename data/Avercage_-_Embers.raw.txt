Through days of thunders 
Continuing stolid smiles to wear 
We're going on 
We nearly carried it to the end 

And every whisper 
And every beat of windy heart 
We're holding on 
For the moment when we unite 

No face 
Is seen at dusk of a raining day 
No name 
Is spoken in a loud voice 
Still still 

One day it all 
will gone forever  will gone forever 
Don’t close your eyes – 
you’ll gone forever  you’ll gone forever. 

Just reach the border 
To throw your past and go ahead 
Hey  light your heart 
as we’re led by a winding thread 

No face 
Is seen at dusk of a raining day 
No name 
Is spoken with the loud voice 
Still still 

One day it all 
will gone forever  will gone forever 
Don’t close your eyes – 
you’ll gone forever  you’ll gone forever. 

And we are one  so I promise 

One day it all 
will gone forever  will gone forever 
Don’t close your eyes – 
you’ll gone forever  you’ll gone forever. 

There’s no more pain 
Which lasts forever 
And never severs. 
Once in the end 
The flame was rendered 
But living embers
Will burn.
