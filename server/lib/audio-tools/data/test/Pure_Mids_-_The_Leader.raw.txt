Now that I have found you I’m okay 
But the people that surround you act strange 
Will we ever fold up don’t say 
Maybe just a heads up is ok 

When I am in focus I seem blind 
I can barely notice the time 
Who can I believe in if not you 
You’re the only reason I’m true 


Aw ah aw ah aw aw ah 
Aw ah aw ah aw aw ah 

I’ve thought enough 
Should I turn this around 
Is this a bluff 
Should I really make a sound 
Am I alright 
Or am I steering out of sight 

Aw ah aw ah aw aw ah 
Aw ah aw ah aw aw ah
