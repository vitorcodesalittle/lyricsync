He's a whistler when the wind blows
Keeps it simple  only whole notes
Plays his hollow tune effortlessly
He just sits there in limbo
Doesn’t listen  full of blow holes
Curtains waver  the old refrain repeats

A penny for a thought
For pounds of flesh he’s bought
A peso for what not to confess here
The last shall be the first
Wordlessly coerced
Death is not the worst atrocity

There’s a hissing through the window
Like a twisted virtuoso
Warning of a storm brewing again
“To the victor ” goes the intro
Full of whispered innuendo
Time once more for a paranoid crusade

The past shall be reversed
The dead not so accursed
A universe rehearsed in tragedy

He's a whistler  he’s a widow
Doesn’t miss her  plays it solo
Blissfully ignoring his instinct
Tears bitter on the pillow
Makes his mission  not to know more
Curtains flutter  the old refrain repeats

Yeah he's a widow
He's a whistler
He's a whistler
Oh
