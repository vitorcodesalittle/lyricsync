through
days
of
thunders
continuing
stolid
smiles
to
wear
we're
going
on
we
nearly
carried
it
to
the
end
and
every
whisper
and
every
beat
of
windy
heart
we're
holding
on
for
the
moment
when
we
unite
no
face
is
seen
at
dusk
of
a
raining
day
no
name
is
spoken
in
a
loud
voice
still
still
one
day
it
all
will
gone
forever
will
gone
forever
dont
close
your
eyes
youll
gone
forever
youll
gone
forever
just
reach
the
border
to
throw
your
past
and
go
ahead
hey
light
your
heart
as
were
led
by
a
winding
thread
no
face
is
seen
at
dusk
of
a
raining
day
no
name
is
spoken
with
the
loud
voice
still
still
one
day
it
all
will
gone
forever
will
gone
forever
dont
close
your
eyes
youll
gone
forever
youll
gone
forever
and
we
are
one
so
i
promise
one
day
it
all
will
gone
forever
will
gone
forever
dont
close
your
eyes
youll
gone
forever
youll
gone
forever
theres
no
more
pain
which
lasts
forever
and
never
severs
once
in
the
end
the
flame
was
rendered
but
living
embers
will
burn
